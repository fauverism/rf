- roadblocks
- ways to get around them
- reach out
- stackoverflow
- other resources

Roadblocks. They suck. Some of them have made me want to put laptop in the chimena. Below are some Do's and Don'ts that I've created as a personal reference, hopefully you'll get something out of it as well. :)

##Dos

- Reach out
	- Stack Overflow
		Sometimes just writing out the story will help
	- friend
	- irc
	- gitter
	

- Limit yourself
	- timers

- write a test/user story



---

##Don'ts

- Don't reward yourself

	- Lack of focus
