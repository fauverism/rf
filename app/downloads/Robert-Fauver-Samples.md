##National Board of Medical Examiners

###Primum Ordering Based Assessment Application

I was brought on board NBME, as a contractor, to implement accessibility features for their Step2 assessment exam application called FRED. This test is part of a series administered to Medical students. A passing grade is needed obtain their medical license. My task was to migrate the code into Chromium frame from an IE frame as well as integrate text zoom and contrast. After the successfully launching FRED it was determined that the accompanying ordering based assessment exam application would be migrated as well. The ordering based app, called Primum, presents the examinee with a patient scenario and the proper treatment/s must be administered in order for a passing outcome. I created design documentation in tandem with a Proof of Concept which is linked below.

###Flumist Quad

During a 3 month freelance stint I worked on a responsive website for flumist, a nasal administration of the flu vaccine. The development practice of creating lots of small files which will assemble into one larger file was incorporated. Bootstrap was used as the design/layout framework and SASS was the CSS extension. The site is optimized for mobile, tablet and devices.
